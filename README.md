## Background
This project was completed under Science Centre Singapore CRADLE lab's Research and Development Experience Programme (RDEP), it was completed in a total of 8 working days, spread out from Feb-May 2022.

In a time when COVID-19 cases were running rampant, personal hygiene became all the more important to limit the spread of COVID. However, people may still unknowingly be touching their faces due to subconscious habits. This project therefore proposes a prototype of a wearable solution to nudge users who are about to touch their face.

## Maintenance
### Changing Batteries (Transmitter)
1. Remove duct tape connecting transmitter to cap.
2. Remove tape holding the box together, the box should open. If not, gently remove one of the sides.
3. Replace batteries (3 × 1.5V) as required.
4. Put the box back together and tape as needed.

### Changing Batteries (Receiver)
1. Locate the top of housing (side with the slit)
2. Use a flat-head screwdriver to gently pry open the top of the housing. *Pry from the sides to prevent damage to the acrylic*.
3. Replace batteries (3 × 1.5V) as required.
4. Put the box back together, *ensuring that the slit is in the right position* for the elliptical cutout.
